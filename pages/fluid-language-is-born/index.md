Hi, everyone! I'm *Alacritas*, a linguist, writer, and budding web developer in love with the study of consciousness. My passion lies in communication, connection, and transformation.

I've started this blog primarily to document my journey to becoming a developer. While I've always been fascinated with programming languages, Life only recently directed me to truly devoting myself to their study. 

Until now, I've dedicated myself to learning "natural" languages, such as French, Bulgarian, Latin, and others; now my journey is going meta, into the constructed languages that form the structure of our modern lives.

## Communication is Creation

Beyond that, I have a vision. A vision of a world where the barriers of communication have fallen. The walls keeping us living in our separated, exclusive little worlds crumble away, only to reveal a wide, open expanse: the Freedom of inclusiveness, the beauty of Silence, and the power of Unity.

Every word is a magical spell. A powerful sequence of sounds that form and shape the world we live in. All of Creation is sound - and this principle is found in a new level with the advent of computer technology and the languages we've created to manipulate it.

I invite you to join me and the rest of the world on an incredible journey. An adventure of creation, connection, and transcendence. 

## Code: Humanity's Universal Language

Even more so than English, programming languages are truly universal. Written and understood by humans and computers around the globe, code is quickly becoming a transformative tool, giving all and sundry the power to create the world they want to live in.

If you're musing about the possibility of learning to code and opening up the ability to create new technologies and improve the lives of those around you - go for it!

Jump right in.

Go to a site such as [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com), [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com), or [TeamTreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), and dive into the world of using words to create your reality.

If [Leo](http://www.upworthy.com/one-time-a-guy-gave-a-homeless-man-a-computer-and-the-recipient-did-exactly-what-the-giver-expected?g=2&c=ufb1) can do it, so can you.

Let's make it happen!
