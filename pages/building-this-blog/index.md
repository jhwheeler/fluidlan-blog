After going through the intro courses on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) and [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com), I was sure this is the path for me.

Doing some more research, I found [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and started learning with Wes Bos' epic course, [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) (I also learned Markdown from his free course).


## Gatsby

Soon thereafter I discovered [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), the platform that I'm using for this blog.

Incredibly simple setup so you can hit the ground running right off the bat. Start customizing the template files, slapping out that content, and more right from the get go. 

But wait, there's more! ;) There's no need for a database, because it's all static pages - no need to manage a complicated backend with this simple framework. Check it out and give it a go - it's super simple! You'll be up and running in 10 minutes.
