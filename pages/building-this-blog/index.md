After going through the intro courses on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com) and [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com), I was sure this is the path for me.

Doing some more research, I found [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and started learning with Wes Bos' epic course, [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) (I also learned Markdown from his free course).

## The Importance of a Mentor

I'm incredibly blessed to have the support of an experienced programmer as my mentor. You can see Hakini's Github [here](https://github.com/dimddev). He's a real powerhouse back-end developer and sysadmin, and having his insights and guidance is key. If you're looking to start programming yourself, find someone you can turn to when you're really stuck - it'll be huge help in the end! But don't ask them for every little thing - part of becoming a true programmer is learning to solve problems on your own. Independence and self-reliance is what it's all about!

## Gatsby

Soon thereafter I discovered [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), the platform that I'm using for this blog.

Incredibly simple setup so you can hit the ground running right off the bat. Start customizing the template files, slapping out that content, and more right from the get go. 

But wait, there's more! ;) There's no need for a database, because it's all static pages - no need to manage a complicated backend with this simple framework. Check it out and give it a go - it's super simple! You'll be up and running in 10 minutes.
